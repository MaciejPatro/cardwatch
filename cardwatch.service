# ---- CPU limits ----
# Hard cap: total CPU time limited to 1 full core for this service (across all its processes).
CPUQuota=100%

# Optional: lock the service to a single CPU core (e.g., CPU 0). 
# This prevents migration across CPUs. Change to a core you prefer (e.g., 3 or 60-63 not allowed here; use one).
# If you only need the 1-core *cap* and don't care which CPU, you can remove this line.

# (Optional) make the service a bit nicer to the rest of your desktop
