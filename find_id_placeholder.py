    # We don't have names in the price guide, only IDs and categories.

    # {"idProduct": 860997, "idCategory": 1657, ...}
    
    # But the URL is generated by ID.
    # The user gave us: https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Riftbound/Products/Booster-Boxes/Origins-Booster-Box
    # We need to find the ID that corresponds to this.
    
    # If we cannot map ID to name from the price guide (because names aren't in it),
    # we have to rely on the scraper finding the correct page by ID.
    
    # However, if the scraper for that ID redirects to Homepage, then we can't scrape it.
    
    # Let's assume the user knows the ID or we can guess it. 
    # Or, maybe we can try to hit the URL provided by the user directly?
    # In `debug_riftbound_booster.py`, we hit the URL directly and it redirected to homepage.
    
    # This implies the URL might be slightly wrong or blocked.
